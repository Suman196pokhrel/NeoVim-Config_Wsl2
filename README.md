## ðŸš€ My NeoVim Configuration

Welcome to my personal NeoVim setup, crafted by a neovim rookie and suited for my needs.


## ðŸŒŸ Used Plugins

- **Lua Scripted**: Modern NeoVim configurations using Lua for clean and efficient setups (just kidding, lua is booming at this time so i found it cool ).
- **Plugin Management with Packer.nvim**: Found to be lightweight  & fast [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
- **Fast Searching with Telescope**: Leveraging the power of [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for fuzzy finding and quick searches.
- **File Explorer with Nvim-Tree**: Because i was missing that vscode feel, [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua).
- **Syntax Highlighting with TreeSitter**: Enhanced code readability and understanding using [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).
- **Aesthetic with TokyoNight**: Who doesn't likes a dark theme in cli coding experience [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
- **Git Integration with Fugitive**: manage and navigate Git with [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).
- **Intelligent Completion with nvim-cmp**: Auto-completion, snippets and more with [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp).
- **LSP Configurations with nvim-lspconfig**: Setting up various language servers easily with [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).
- **Python Development with Pyright**: Static type checking for Python with the [Pyright language server](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).
- **JavaScript & TypeScript Development with tsserver**: Rich features and IntelliSense for JS and TS via [typescript-language-server](https://github.com/typescript-language/typescript-language-server).

## ðŸŽ‰ Heads Up!

As I dive deeper into the NeoVim rabbit hole, I'll be sprinkling in more cool tweaks here and there (if i need them ).
