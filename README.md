## ðŸš€ My NeoVim Configuration

Welcome to my personal NeoVim setup, crafted by a neovim rookie and suited for my needs.


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Lua Scripted**: Modern NeoVim configurations using Lua for clean and efficient setups (just kidding, lua is booming at this time so i found it cool ).
- **Plugin Management with Packer.nvim**: Found to be lightweight  & fast [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
- **Fast Searching with Telescope**: Leveraging the power of [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for fuzzy finding and quick searches.
- **File Explorer with Nvim-Tree**: Because i was missing that vscode feel, [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua).
- **Syntax Highlighting with TreeSitter**: Enhanced code readability and understanding using [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).
- **Aesthetic with TokyoNight**: Who doesn't likes a dark theme in cli coding experience [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)

## ðŸŽ‰ Heads Up!

As I dive deeper into the NeoVim rabbit hole, I'll be sprinkling in more cool tweaks here and there (if i need them ).
